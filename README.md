Seattle 911 Police Calls 
====================
Data Set
--------------------
The dataset we chose looks at 911 calls to the police department and is updated on a 4 hour basis by the city of Seattle. The calls are separated into groups and then into further subgroups.  Each call has information about the sector, id, time and beat where the call took place.  We thought this would be interesting to see where certain crimes take place in the city and to easily see if there are patterns as to where certain types of crime take place. The data can be obtained from <a href="http://data.seattle.com">data.seattle.com</a>.
