We want to geoencode crime data around the Seattle area. Socrata has a great API 
that allows you to pull data from 911 calls which we wil use. We want
people to be able to look through different types of crime around Seattle on a
map. Ideally people would be able to choose different types of crimes to look at
and also have the ability to filter requests by time. We want to split our 
nominal variables(types of crime) up into different color dots and display
them on the map. People should be able to click on the circles to 
bring up more information about the specific crime. 

This geographic type of display gives us more of an indication of where various
crimes happen around the city. For instance, if you filter by sex crimes, you should
essentially only see crimes happening on Aurora. Geo-encoding our data
effectively gives people an idea of where crime happens around the city. 

We believe searching by neighborhood would also be valuable to this project. It'd
be interesting to filter strictly by neighborhoods. We are also considering adding
a statistics tool which would contain info on crimes throughout different
neighborhoods.

By providing a time filter, people can see how crime shifts by location over time.
This adds an effective new dimension to our vizualization. Our color coding provides
continuity over the different types of crime that happen throughout the city.

In the same vain as our color coding, we want to add a heatmap. This might give
way to more of an understanding of where crimes happen in Seattle.
